# Python-challenge

This module challenge contains 2 tasks: PyBank and PyPoll

## PyBank
In PyBank, the task is to analyse the financial records of a company.

The "main.py" script reads from the "budgetdata.csv" file, analyses the data therein and outputs the analysis result to the terminal and a text file "PyBank.txt". The result consists of the following:
1. The total number of months included in the dataset
2. The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
3. The average change in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
4. The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
5. The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

## PyPoll
In PyPoll, the task is to analyse the voting outcome of a small, rural U.S. town.

The "main.py" script reads from the "electiondata.csv" file, analyses the data therein and outputs the analysis result to the terminal and a text file "PyPoll.txt". The result consists of the following:
1. The total number of votes cast
2. A complete list of candidates who received votes
3. The percentage of votes each candidate won
4. The total number of votes each candidate won
5. The winner of the election based on popular vote
